# 61. Rotate List

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

---

## Example

**Input:**
head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

**Output:**
[4,5,1,2,3]

**Explanation:**
- After 1st rotation: [5,1,2,3,4]
- After 2nd rotation: [4,5,1,2,3]

---

## Edge Cases

- If `head` is `None`, return `None`.
- If `k` is 0 or a multiple of the list's length, return original list.
- Single node list: return the same list.
- Large `k` values: reduce using `k % length`.

---

## Intuition

1. First, find the length of the list and the last node.
2. Link the last node to the head (make it circular).
3. Break the circle at the correct position to rotate.
4. New head will be at position `length - (k % length)`.

---

## Dry Run

Given: `head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`

1. Length = 5
2. `k % 5 = 2`
3. New head is at position `5 - 2 = 3` (0-based index)
4. Break the link after `2nd` node (`3rd` node becomes new head)
5. Result: [4,5,1,2,3]

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None

        # Step 1: Find length and last node
        count, lastElement = 1, head
        while lastElement.next:
            count += 1
            lastElement = lastElement.next

        # Step 2: Adjust k
        k = k % count
        if k == 0:
            return head

        # Step 3: Make it circular
        lastElement.next = head

        # Step 4: Find new head
        tempNode = head
        for _ in range(count - k - 1):
            tempNode = tempNode.next

        # Step 5: Break the circle
        answer = tempNode.next
        tempNode.next = None

        return answer
```
