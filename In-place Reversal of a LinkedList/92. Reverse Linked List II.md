# 92. Reverse Linked List II

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` (where `1 <= left <= right <= length of list`), reverse the **nodes from position `left` to position `right`**, and return the modified list.

---

## Example:

**Input:**

head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], left = 2, right = 4

**Output:**

[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]

**Explanation:**

The sublist `[2, 3, 4]` is reversed to `[4, 3, 2]`.

---

## Edge Cases to Consider:

- If `head` is `None`: return `None`.
- If `left == right`: no change is needed.
- If `left == 1`: we need to reverse starting from the head node.

---

## Approach: In-place Sublist Reversal

We use a dummy node before the head to handle edge cases easily (especially when `left = 1`). We identify the node just before the sublist (`prev`), and perform reversal for `right - left` steps.

---

## Steps:

1. Create a `dummy` node and point it to `head`.
2. Move `prev` to the node just before the `left`-th node.
3. Use a `cur` pointer to the `left`-th node.
4. Reverse the sublist by adjusting pointers:
   - For each node in the range `[left, right]`:
     - Extract the node next to `cur`.
     - Move it to the front of the sublist.
5. Finally, return `dummy.next`.

---

## Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or left == right:
            return head
        
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        prev = dummy
        
        # Move prev to the node before reversal starts
        for _ in range(left - 1):
            prev = prev.next
        
        # Reverse the sublist between left and right
        cur = prev.next
        for _ in range(right - left):
            temp = cur.next             # Node to be repositioned
            cur.next = temp.next        # Remove temp from its current position
            temp.next = prev.next       # Insert temp after prev
            prev.next = temp
        
        return dummy.next
```
### Visualization (Key Iteration for [1,2,3,4,5], left=2, right=4)
- Initial: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
- Step 1: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
- Step 2: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5
### Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)

- Single pass to reach left, and then up to (right - left) pointer adjustments.

Space Complexity: O(1)

- In-place operations using constant extra space.
