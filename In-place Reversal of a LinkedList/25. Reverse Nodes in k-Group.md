# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

- If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining nodes at the end should remain as is.
- Only the nodes' **connections** can be changed, not their values.
- Must be done **in-place** with constant extra memory.

---

## Example:

**Input:**
head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2

**Output:**
[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]

**Explanation:**
- First reverse: [2, 1]
- Second reverse: [4, 3]
- Remaining node: [5] (unchanged)

---

## Edge Cases

- If `head` is `None`: return `None`.
- If `k == 1`: return original list (no reversal needed).
- If total nodes < `k`: no reversal.
- Proper handling of node connections between reversed segments.

---

## Approach: In-place Reversal with Dummy Node

### Idea:

1. Count total nodes in the list.
2. Use a dummy node to simplify edge cases.
3. For every group of `k` nodes:
   - Reverse the group using in-place pointer manipulation.
   - Move the `prev` pointer to the end of the reversed group.
4. If remaining nodes < `k`, leave them untouched.

## Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or k == 1:
            return head

        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        prev = dummy
        curr = head

        # Step 1: Count number of nodes
        n = 0
        while curr:
            n += 1
            curr = curr.next

        # Step 2: Reverse in groups of k
        while n >= k:
            curr = prev.next
            nxt = curr.next

            # Reverse k nodes
            for _ in range(1, k):
                curr.next = nxt.next
                nxt.next = prev.next
                prev.next = nxt
                nxt = curr.next
            
            # Move prev pointer to the end of the reversed group
            prev = curr
            n -= k

        return dummy.next
```
## Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity:	O(n)
- Space Complexity:	O(1)
