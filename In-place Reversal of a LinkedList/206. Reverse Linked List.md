# 206. Reverse Linked List

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the **reversed list**.

---

## Example:

**Input:**
head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Output:**
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

## Approach: Iterative Method

We can reverse the linked list by changing the direction of the `next` pointers one by one as we iterate through the list.

### Steps:

1. Initialize:
   - `prev = None` (will eventually become the new head)
   - `curr = head` (current node we're processing)

2. Iterate through the list:
   - Store the next node: `nex = curr.next`
   - Reverse the pointer: `curr.next = prev`
   - Move both pointers one step forward:
     - `prev = curr`
     - `curr = nex`

3. Return `prev` which will be the new head of the reversed list.

## Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr:
            nex = curr.next      # Save next node
            curr.next = prev     # Reverse the pointer
            prev = curr          # Move prev forward
            curr = nex           # Move curr forward
        
        return prev              # New head of reversed list
```

Time Complexity: O(n)

- Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(1)

- Only a constant amount of extra memory is used.
