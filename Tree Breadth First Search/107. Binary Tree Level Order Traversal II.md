# üìö 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

## üìù Problem Statement 
Given the root of a binary tree, return the **bottom-up level order traversal** of its nodes' values.  
(i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

---

## üì• Example  
#### Input:  
`root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`  
Output:  
`[[15,7],[9,20],[3]]`

---

## üí° Approach  
- If the tree is empty, return an empty list.
- Use a queue to perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- For each level:
  - Record the number of nodes at the current level.
  - Traverse all those nodes, storing their values in a list.
  - Add their left and right children (if present) to the queue.
- Append each level‚Äôs list to the result.
- Finally, reverse the result list to get bottom-up order.

## ‚úÖ Python Code
```python

class Solution:
    def levelOrderBottom(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []

        q = deque([root])
        res = []

        while q:
            level = []
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                level.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            res.append(level)

        return res[::-1]  # Reverse to get bottom-up order
```
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
O(n) ‚Äî where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.

üíæ Space Complexity
O(n) ‚Äî for the queue and the result list in the worst-case scenario (full binary tree).
