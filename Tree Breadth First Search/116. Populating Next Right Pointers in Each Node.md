## üìö 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

### üìù Problem Statement  
You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.  

Populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `NULL`.  
Initially, all `next` pointers are set to `NULL`.

---

### üì• Example  
**Input:**  
`root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`  

**Output:**  
After running your function, the tree's next pointers will be populated like this:  
    1 ‚Üí NULL
    \
  2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí NULL
 \
4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7 ‚Üí NULL

---

### üí° Approach  
- Start from the root and traverse level by level.
- For each node at the current level:
  - Connect its left child‚Äôs `next` to its right child.
  - If the node has a `next`, connect its right child‚Äôs `next` to the left child of the `next` node.
- Move to the next level starting from the leftmost node.

### ‚úÖ Python Code
```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        cur, nex = root, root.left if root else None

        while cur and nex:
            # Connect left child to right child
            cur.left.next = cur.right
            
            # Connect right child to the next node's left child
            if cur.next:
                cur.right.next = cur.next.left
            
            # Move to next node in current level
            cur = cur.next

            # If current level ends, move to next level
            if not cur:
                cur = nex
                nex = cur.left

        return root
```
### OR
```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':

        if root == None or not root.left:
            return root

        root.left.next = root.right

        if root.next:
            root.right.next = root.next.left

        self.connect(root.left)
        self.connect(root.right)

        return root
```
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
O(n) ‚Äî Each node is visited once.

üíæ Space Complexity
O(1) ‚Äî No extra space used except pointers; operates in constant space.
