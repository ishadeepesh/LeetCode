# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

## üîç Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the **length of the diameter** of the tree.

> The diameter is the **length of the longest path** between any two nodes. This path **may or may not pass through the root**.

üìå The **length of a path** between two nodes is the **number of edges** between them.

---

## üß™ Example

**Input:**
root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Output:**
3

**Explanation:**
- The longest path is: `4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3` or `5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3`
- It includes 4 nodes ‚Üí 3 edges ‚Üí diameter = 3

## üí° Approach

### üîÅ DFS (Depth First Search)

We perform a **post-order DFS** traversal:
1. For each node, compute the **depth of its left and right subtrees**.
2. The **diameter** at the current node is the **sum of left and right depths**.
3. Keep track of the **maximum diameter** encountered so far.
4. Return the **depth of the current node** as `1 + max(left, right)`.

## üßæ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.diameter = 0

        def dfs(root) -> int:
            if not root:
                return 0
            ld = dfs(root.left)
            rd = dfs(root.right)
            self.diameter = max(self.diameter, ld + rd)  # diameter = edges
            return 1 + max(ld, rd)

        dfs(root)
        return self.diameter
```
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity: O(n)
Each node is visited exactly once.

‚è±Ô∏èSpace Complexity: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack). In worst case (skewed tree), O(n).
