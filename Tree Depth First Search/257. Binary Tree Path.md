## 🌳 257. Binary Tree Paths

### 📝 Problem Statement  
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return **all root-to-leaf paths** in **any order**.  
A **leaf** is a node with no children.

---

### 📥 Example  

**Input:**  
`root = [1,2,3,null,5]`  

**Output:**  
`["1->2->5","1->3"]`  

---

### 💡 Approach  

1. Use **DFS (Depth-First Search)** to explore all root-to-leaf paths.
2. Keep appending node values to a `path` list as strings.
3. When a leaf node is reached, join the `path` with `"->"` and append to result list.
4. Use **backtracking** to explore all possible paths.

### ✅ Python Code  
```python
class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        def dfs(root, res, path):
            if not root:
                return 

            path.append(str(root.val))  # Add current node to path

            if not root.left and not root.right:  # If it's a leaf
                res.append('->'.join(path))       # Save path as string

            dfs(root.left, res, path)    # Recur left
            dfs(root.right, res, path)   # Recur right

            path.pop()  # Backtrack
        
        res, path = [], []
        dfs(root, res, path)
        return res
```
⏱️ Time Complexity
O(n²) — Because each path may have up to n nodes and joining strings takes time.

💾 Space Complexity
O(n) — For recursion stack and path list.
