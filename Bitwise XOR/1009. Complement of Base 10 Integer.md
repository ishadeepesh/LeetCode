## ✅ 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

---

### 🧾 Question:
The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`s to `1`s and all the `1`s to `0`s in its **binary representation**.

For example:  
- The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary.
- Its complement is `"010"`, which is `2` in decimal.

Given an integer `n`, return its **complement**.

---

### 🔹 Example:

**Input:**
n = 5

**Output:**
2

**Explanation:**  
- Binary of `5` is `"101"`.
- Complement is `"010"` which is `2` in base-10.

### ✅ Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def bitwiseComplement(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        mask = (1 << n.bit_length()) - 1
        return mask ^ n
```
⏱️ Time Complexity:
O(1)

- The number of operations depends on the number of bits (max 32 bits for an integer), so it is treated as constant.

📦 Space Complexity:
O(1)

- Uses only constant space.
