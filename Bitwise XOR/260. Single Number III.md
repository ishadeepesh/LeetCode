## ‚úÖ 260. Single Number III

---

### üßæ Question:
Given an integer array `nums`, in which **exactly two elements appear only once** and all the other elements appear exactly twice, find the two elements that appear only once.

You must write an algorithm that:
- Runs in **linear runtime complexity** `O(n)`, and
- Uses only **constant extra space** `O(1)`.

---

### üîπ Example:

**Input:**
nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]

**Output:**
[3, 5]

**Explanation:**  
Only `3` and `5` appear once. `[5, 3]` is also a valid answer since the order doesn't matter.

### ‚úÖ Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        overallXOR = 0
        for i in nums:
            overallXOR ^= i  # XOR of the two unique numbers

        rightMostSetBit = 0
        while (overallXOR >> rightMostSetBit) & 1 != 1:
            rightMostSetBit += 1  # Find a differing bit

        zeroGroup = 0
        oneGroup = 0
        for n in nums:
            if (n >> rightMostSetBit) & 1 == 1:
                oneGroup ^= n
            else:
                zeroGroup ^= n

        return [oneGroup, zeroGroup]
```
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
O(n)

One pass to compute the XOR of all elements.

Second pass to separate into two groups and compute XOR within each.

üì¶ Space Complexity:
O(1)

Uses only a few variables regardless of input size.
