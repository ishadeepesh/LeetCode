## ✅ 136. Single Number

---

### 🧾 Question:
Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, **every element appears twice except for one**.  
Find that **single one**.

You must implement a solution with:
- Linear runtime complexity (**O(n)**), and
- Use only **constant extra space**.

---

### 🔹 Example:

**Input:**
nums = [2, 2, 1]

**Output:**
1

**Explanation:**  
Only the number `1` appears once. All other elements appear exactly twice.

---

### ✅ Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in nums:
            ans = ans ^ i
        return ans
```
⏱️ Time Complexity:
O(n)
Iterates through the list once.

📦 Space Complexity:
O(1)
Uses only a constant amount of extra space (ans variable).
