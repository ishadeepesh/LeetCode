# 41. First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest **positive** integer that is **not** present in `nums`.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** auxiliary space.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**
nums = [1, 2, 0]


**Output:**
3

**Explanation:**
The numbers `1` and `2` are present in the array, but `3` is the first missing positive number.

---

## Approach:

We use **cyclic sort** to place every integer `i` (in the range 1 to `n`) at index `i - 1`.

### Steps:

1. Iterate over the array:
   - While `nums[i]` is in the range `[1, n]` and not in its correct position (`nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]`), **swap** it to the correct position.

2. After rearrangement, the array should have:
   - `nums[i] == i + 1` for all valid indices.

3. If any index `i` has `nums[i] != i + 1`, return `i + 1` as the first missing positive.

4. If all are correct, return `n + 1`.

## Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Function to swap elements in the array
        def swap(arr, i, j):
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Place each positive integer i at index i-1 if possible
        for i in range(n):
            while 0 < nums[i] <= n and nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]:
                swap(nums, i, nums[i] - 1)
        
        # Find the first missing positive integer
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != i + 1:
                return i + 1
        
        # If all positive integers from 1 to n are present, return n + 1
        return n + 1
#OR
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i,n=0,len(nums)
    
        while i<n:
            j=nums[i]-1
            if j>=0 and j<n and nums[i]!=nums[j]:
                nums[i],nums[j]=nums[j],nums[i]
            else:
                i+=1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i]!=i+1:
                return i+1
                
        return n+1
            
```
Time Complexity:
O(n) — Each element is moved at most once.

Space Complexity:
O(1) — Constant space used; sorting is done in-place.
