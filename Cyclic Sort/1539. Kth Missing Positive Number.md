# 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`, return the **kth positive integer** that is **missing** from this array.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**
arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5

**Output:**
9

**Explanation:**
The missing numbers are: `[1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...]`.  
The 5th missing number is **9**.

## Approach 1: Brute Force (Linear Scan)

We simulate numbers from `1` onwards and check whether they are present in the array. If not, we count them as missing until we find the `k`th one.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `num = 1`, `i = 0`, and loop through until `k == 0`.
2. If `num == arr[i]`, move to next element in `arr`.
3. If `num != arr[i]`, it's missing â€” decrement `k`.
4. Return the last missing number once `k` becomes 0.

### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        num, i, n = 1, 0, len(arr)
        while i < n:
            if arr[i] == num:
                i += 1
            else:
                k -= 1
                if k == 0:
                    return num
            num += 1
        while k != 0:
            num += 1
            k -= 1
        return num - 1
```
Time Complexity:
O(n + k) in worst case.

Space Complexity:
O(1)

## Approach 2: Binary Search
We use binary search to find the smallest index i such that the count of missing numbers arr[i] - i - 1 >= k.

### Insight:
At index i, the number of missing integers before arr[i] is:
arr[i] - i - 1

We perform binary search on this condition.

Code:
```python

class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        lo, hi = 0, len(arr)
        while lo < hi:
            mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2
            if arr[mid] - mid > k:
                hi = mid
            else:
                lo = mid + 1
        return lo + k
```
Time Complexity:
O(log n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)
