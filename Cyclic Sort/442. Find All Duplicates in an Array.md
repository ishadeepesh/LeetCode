# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **at most twice**, return an array of all the integers that appear **exactly twice**.

You must solve the problem in **O(n)** time using **constant extra space**, not counting the output list.

## Example:

**Input:**
nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]


**Output:**
[2,3]

## Approach: Marking Visited Numbers Using Negation

### Key Idea:

Since all numbers are in the range `[1, n]`, we can use the input array itself to mark whether we've seen a number before by **flipping the sign** of the value at the index `abs(x) - 1`.

- When we first encounter a number `x`, we flip the sign of `nums[x - 1]`.
- If we encounter `x` again and `nums[x - 1]` is already negative, we know it's a duplicate.

### Steps:

1. Iterate over each element in `nums`.
2. Take the absolute value `x = abs(nums[i])`.
3. Check the sign of `nums[x - 1]`:
   - If negative, `x` is a duplicate, add to result.
   - Otherwise, flip it to negative.
4. Return the collected duplicates.

### Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        for x in nums:
            x = abs(x)
            if nums[x - 1] < 0:
                ans.append(x)
            else:
                nums[x - 1] *= -1
        return ans
```

#### Time Complexity: O(n)

- Each number is visited once and checked in constant time.

#### Space Complexity: O(1)

- No extra space is used other than the output list.
