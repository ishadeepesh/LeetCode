## ✅ 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return this repeated number.

You **must solve the problem** without modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
nums = [1,3,4,2,2]

**Output:**
2

---

### Approach:

We use **Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection Algorithm)**. Think of the input array as a linked list where the value at each index points to the next index. Due to the duplicate, there will be a cycle.

- **Phase 1**: Detect the cycle using two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) until they meet.
- **Phase 2**: Reset one pointer to the start and move both one step at a time to find the entrance to the cycle — which is the duplicate number.

### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Phase 1: Detect intersection point of the cycle
        slow = nums[0]
        fast = nums[0]
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break

        # Phase 2: Find entrance to the cycle (duplicate number)
        slow = nums[0]
        while slow != fast:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[fast]

        return slow
```
⏱️ Time Complexity:
O(n) — Linear time to detect cycle and find entry point.

📦 Space Complexity:
O(1) — Only a constant number of pointers used, no extra data structures.
