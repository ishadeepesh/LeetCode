# 📘 234. Palindrome Linked List

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome or `false` otherwise.

---

## 📥 Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2,2,1]`  
**Output:**  
`true`

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2]`  
**Output:**  
`false`

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

---

## 💡 Follow-up

Can you solve this in **O(n) time** and **O(1) space**?

## 💡 Approach: Fast and Slow Pointer + Reverse Second Half

1. Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to find the middle of the list.
2. Reverse the second half of the list starting from the `slow` pointer.
3. Compare the first half and reversed second half node by node.
4. If all corresponding nodes match, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

## ✅ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        # Step 1: Find the middle using slow and fast pointers
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        prev = None
        while slow:
            temp = slow.next
            slow.next = prev
            prev = slow
            slow = temp

        # Step 3: Compare first half and reversed second half
        left, right = head, prev
        while right:
            if left.val != right.val:
                return False
            left = left.next
            right = right.next

        return True
```
⏱️ Time Complexity
O(n) — We traverse the list at most 3 times (finding middle, reversing half, comparing).

💾 Space Complexity
O(1) — We use constant space by reversing the list in-place.
