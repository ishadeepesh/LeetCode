# üîÑ 143. Reorder List

## üìù Problem Statement

You are given the head of a singly linked list. The list can be represented as:

L0 ‚Üí L1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Ln-1 ‚Üí Ln

Reorder it to the form:

L0 ‚Üí Ln ‚Üí L1 ‚Üí Ln-1 ‚Üí L2 ‚Üí Ln-2 ‚Üí ...

You **may not modify** the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

## üì• Example

**Input:**  
`head = [1, 2, 3, 4]`  
**Output:**  
`[1, 4, 2, 3]`

**Input:**  
`head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
**Output:**  
`[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`

---

## üí° Approach

1. **Find the middle** of the linked list using the **slow and fast pointers**.
2. **Reverse the second half** of the list.
3. **Merge** the two halves:
   - Start from the beginning of the first half and interleave nodes from the reversed second half.

## ‚úÖ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        # Step 1: Find the middle of the list
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # Step 2: Reverse the second half
        second = slow.next
        prev = None
        slow.next = None  # Split the list into two parts
        while second:
            temp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = temp

        # Step 3: Merge the two halves
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2
```
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
O(n) ‚Äî We traverse the list 3 times: once to find the middle, once to reverse, once to merge.

üíæ Space Complexity
O(1) ‚Äî No extra space used apart from a few pointers.
