# 202. Happy Number

## Problem Statement

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is a happy number.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

1. Start with any positive integer.
2. Replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
3. Repeat the process until:
   - The number equals 1 (then it **is** a happy number), or
   - It loops endlessly in a cycle **not** including 1 (then it **is not** a happy number).

---

## Example:

**Input:**  
`n = 19`

**Process:**
#### 1² + 9² = 82
#### 8² + 2² = 68
#### 6² + 8² = 100
#### 1² + 0² + 0² = 1

**Output:**  
`True` (19 is a happy number)

---

## Approach:

- Use a `set` to keep track of all visited numbers to detect cycles.
- If `n` becomes 1, return `True`.
- If a number repeats (i.e., seen before), return `False` (cycle detected).
- Use a helper function to compute the sum of squares of digits.

## Python Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def findSumOfSquares(self, num: int) -> int:
        sumVal = 0
        while num != 0:
            rem = num % 10
            sumVal += rem * rem
            num = num // 10
        return sumVal

    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        visit = set()
        while n not in visit:
            visit.add(n)
            n = self.findSumOfSquares(n)
            if n == 1:
                return True
        return False
```
Time Complexity:
O(log n) per step (to compute the sum of squares of digits).

Total steps are limited due to cycle detection, so overall complexity is O(log n) amortized.

Space Complexity:
O(log n) — to store visited numbers in the set.
