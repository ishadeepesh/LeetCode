# 141. Linked List Cycle

## Problem Statement

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list **has a cycle** in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example:

**Input:**

`3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4`  
       

**Output:**  
True
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next          # Move slow by 1 step
            fast = fast.next.next     # Move fast by 2 steps

            if slow == fast:
                return True           # Cycle detected
        
        return False                  # No cycle found
