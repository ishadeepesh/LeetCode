# 📘 876. Middle of the Linked List

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the **middle node** of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the **second** middle node.

---

## 📥 Example

**Input:**  
`head = [1,2,3,4,5]`

**Output:**  
`[3,4,5]`

**Explanation:**  
The middle node of the list is node 3.

---

## 💡 Approach: Two Pointers (Fast and Slow)

- Initialize two pointers: `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head.
- Move `slow` by one node at a time.
- Move `fast` by two nodes at a time.
- When `fast` reaches the end (or `fast.next` is `None`), `slow` will be at the middle.

This approach ensures that you find the middle in a **single pass**.

## ✅ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        return slow
```
⏱️ Time Complexity
O(n) — We traverse the linked list once where n is the number of nodes.

💾 Space Complexity
O(1) — We use constant extra space, just two pointers.
