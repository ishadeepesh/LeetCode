# 142. Linked List Cycle II

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list, return the **node where the cycle begins**. If there is **no cycle**, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.

ðŸš« Do **not** modify the linked list.

## Example:

**Input:**

3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4 

**Output:**

The node with value `2`, where the cycle begins.

---

## Approach: Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection)

1. First, use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to detect if a cycle exists.
2. If they meet, there's a cycle.
3. To find the **starting node** of the cycle:
   - Move one pointer (`slow`) back to the head.
   - Move both pointers one step at a time.
   - They will meet again **at the start of the cycle**.

## Python Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                # Cycle detected; find the entry point
                slow = head
                while slow != fast:
                    slow = slow.next
                    fast = fast.next
                return slow  # Start of the cycle

        return None  # No cycle
```
Time Complexity:
O(n) â€” where n is the number of nodes.

Space Complexity:
O(1) â€” only pointers are used.
