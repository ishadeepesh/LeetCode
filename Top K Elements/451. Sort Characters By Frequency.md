# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

## ✅ Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency** of the characters.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

---

## 🧪 Example

### Input:
s = "tree"

### Output:
"eert"

### Explanation:
- `'e'` appears **2 times**, `'r'` and `'t'` appear **once** each.
- Most frequent characters should appear first.
- Both `"eetr"` and `"eert"` are valid outputs.

---

## 💡 Approach: HashMap + Sorting

### Steps:
1. Use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each character.
2. Sort the characters in **descending order** based on their frequency.
3. Build the output string by repeating each character according to its frequency.

## ✅ Code (Sorting by Frequency)

```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        count = Counter(s)  # Step 1: Count frequency of each character
        
        res = []

        # Step 2: Sort characters by frequency in descending order
        for k, v in sorted(count.items(), key=lambda x: -x[1]):
            res.append(k * v)  # Step 3: Append character v times
        
        return ''.join(res)
```
#### ⏱ Time and Space Complexity
#### 🕒 Time Complexity	O(N log N)
#### 💾 Space Complexity	O(N)

N is the length of the string s.

O(N log N) due to sorting the frequency map.

O(N) for the frequency map and result list.
