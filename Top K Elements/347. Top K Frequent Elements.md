# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

## âœ… Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements.

You may return the answer in **any order**.

---

## ðŸ§ª Example

### Input:
nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

### Output:
[1,2]

### Explanation:
- `1` occurs 3 times  
- `2` occurs 2 times  
- `3` occurs 1 time  
The two most frequent elements are `[1, 2]`.

## ðŸ’¡ Approach: Bucket Sort

### Intuition:
- Count the frequency of each number using a hashmap.
- Create a list of buckets where the index represents the frequency.
- Each bucket contains numbers that appear with that frequency.
- Traverse the buckets from highest frequency to lowest and collect the top `k` frequent elements.

## âœ… Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        count = {}  # Frequency map
        freq = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]  # Buckets

        # Step 1: Count frequencies
        for num in nums:
            count[num] = 1 + count.get(num, 0)

        # Step 2: Fill buckets
        for num, c in count.items():
            freq[c].append(num)

        # Step 3: Collect top-k frequent elements from buckets
        res = []
        for i in range(len(freq) - 1, 0, -1):
            for num in freq[i]:
                res.append(num)
                if len(res) == k:
                    return res
```

	
### ðŸ•’ Time	 Complexity :  O(N)
### ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity: 	O(N)

#### N is the number of elements in nums.

#### Building the frequency map takes O(N).

#### The freq bucket list also uses space proportional to O(N).
