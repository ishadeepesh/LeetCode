# 📚 56. Merge Intervals

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all **overlapping intervals**, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

---

## 📥 Example

**Input:**  
`intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`  
**Output:**  
`[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`  
**Explanation:** Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

**Input:**  
`intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`  
**Output:**  
`[[1,5]]`

---

## 💡 Approach

1. **Sort the intervals** based on their starting points.
2. Initialize an output list with the first interval.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals:
   - If the current interval's start is **less than or equal to** the end of the last interval in output, they overlap. **Merge** them by updating the end of the last interval.
   - Otherwise, **append** the current interval to the output list as it doesn't overlap.

## ✅ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Sort intervals by start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda i: i[0])
        
        output = [intervals[0]]
        
        for start, end in intervals[1:]:
            lastEnd = output[-1][1]
            if start <= lastEnd:
                # Overlap exists, merge
                output[-1][1] = max(lastEnd, end)
            else:
                # No overlap, add to output
                output.append([start, end])
        
        return output
```
⏱️ Time Complexity
O(n log n) — Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n), and merging takes O(n).

💾 Space Complexity
O(n) — Required to store the output list of merged intervals.
