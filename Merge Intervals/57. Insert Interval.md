# 📚 57. Insert Interval

## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an array of **non-overlapping** intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and end of the i-th interval, and `intervals` is **sorted** in ascending order by `starti`.

You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that needs to be inserted into the list. **Merge overlapping intervals** if necessary so that the result remains non-overlapping and sorted.

Return the updated list of intervals.

## 📥 Example

**Input:**  
`intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]`  
**Output:**  
`[[1,5],[6,9]]`

**Input:**  
`intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]`  
**Output:**  
`[[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]`

## 💡 Approach

1. **Append the `newInterval`** to the list of intervals.
2. **Sort** the intervals by their start time.
3. Use the same logic as **Merge Intervals**:
   - Initialize an output list with the first interval.
   - For each interval, check:
     - If it overlaps with the last in the output, **merge** it.
     - Otherwise, simply **append** it.

## ✅ Python Code

```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals.append(newInterval)
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        output = []
        for interval in intervals:
            if not output or interval[0] > output[-1][1]:
                output.append(interval)
            else:
                output[-1][1] = max(output[-1][1], interval[1])
        return output
```
⏱️ Time Complexity
O(n log n) — For sorting the intervals after inserting the new one.

O(n) — For merging.

💾 Space Complexity
O(n) — To store the merged output list.
