## ✅ 207. Course Schedule

---

### 🧾 Question:
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`.  
You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` indicates that you **must take course `b` first if you want to take course `a`**.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

---

### 🔹 Example:

**Input:**
numCourses = 2
prerequisites = [[1, 0]]


**Output:**
true


**Explanation:**  
To take course 1, you must first take course 0. So it is possible to finish all courses.

### ✅ Code:

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        adj = [[] for i in range(numCourses)]
        indegree = [0] * numCourses
        ans = []

        for pair in prerequisites:
            course = pair[1]
            prerequisite = pair[0]
            adj[prerequisite].append(course)
            indegree[course] += 1

        queue = deque()
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)

        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            ans.append(current)

            for next_course in adj[current]:
                indegree[next_course] -= 1
                if indegree[next_course] == 0:
                    queue.append(next_course)

        return len(ans) == numCourses
```
⏱️ Time Complexity:
O(V + E)
Where V is the number of courses (numCourses) and E is the number of prerequisite pairs.

📦 Space Complexity:
O(V + E)
For the adjacency list and indegree array.
