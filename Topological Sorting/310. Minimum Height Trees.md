## ✅ 310. Minimum Height Trees

---

### 🧾 Question:
A **tree** is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.  
In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` edges where `edges[i] = [a, b]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `a` and `b` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root.  

When you select a node `x` as the root, the resulting tree has height `h`.  
Among all possible rooted trees, those with **minimum height (i.e., min(h))** are called **minimum height trees (MHTs)**.

Return a list of all **MHTs' root labels**. You can return the answer in any order.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

### 🔹 Example:

**Input:**
n = 4
edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

**Output:**
[1]

**Explanation:**  
The height of the tree is minimum (1) when the root is the node labeled `1`.

### ✅ Code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if n == 1:
            return [0]

        adj = defaultdict(list)
        for n1, n2 in edges:
            adj[n1].append(n2)
            adj[n2].append(n1)

        edge_cnt = {}
        leaves = deque()

        for src, neighbors in adj.items():
            if len(neighbors) == 1:
                leaves.append(src)
            edge_cnt[src] = len(neighbors)

        while leaves:
            if n <= 2:
                return list(leaves)
            for _ in range(len(leaves)):
                node = leaves.popleft()
                n -= 1
                for nei in adj[node]:
                    edge_cnt[nei] -= 1
                    if edge_cnt[nei] == 1:
                        leaves.append(nei)
```
⏱️ Time Complexity:
O(n)
Each node and edge is visited at most once.

📦 Space Complexity:
O(n)
For adjacency list, degree count, and queue.
